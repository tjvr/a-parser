# grammar

The `grammar` module provides a framework for defining context-free grammars.

* `node.js` contains types for representing parse trees
* `meta.js` describes how to turn a BNF-like description of a grammar into a parse tree
* `grammar.js` contains types for defining and manipulating context-free grammars, and code for turning the parse tree of a grammar into a Grammar object
